# Metalsmith Debug UI

Browser based debug interface for [metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io)

Provides nice ui to navigate metalsmith files and metadata, allowing you to view different stages in the build process

Features:

 * nice ui for exploring files, metadata & logs
 * can jump forwards and backwards through the build process
 * cool vue based client

## install

`yarn add metalsmith-debug-ui`

## usage
`metalsmith-debug-ui` clones your metalsmith files and metadata strutures at
different times during the build process and stores this history. Then it
injects a browser based client into your build output which allows you to view
that history.

Import the plugin and use it to create snapshots during the build process.

Note that logs will only be captured after the first snapshot.

```javascript
import Metalsmith from 'metalsmith'
import snapshot from 'metalsmith-debug-ui'

const metalsmith = Metalsmith('src')

metalsmith
  .use(snapshot())
  .use(myFirstPlugin({...}))
  .use(mySecondPlugin({...}))
  .use(snapshot())
  .use(myThirdPlugin({...}))
  .use(snapshot())
  .build(...)
```

## output
A client to view snapshots and logs will be written to `/debug-ui` in your build folder.

If you're using `browser-sync` or similar to serve your project at `http://localhost:3000` then the url will be `http://localhost:3000/debug-ui/index.html`.

## patching metalsmith
As an alternative to taking arbitrary snapshots, you can patch the metalsmith instance to take a snapshot after every plugin.

```javascript
import Metalsmith from 'metalsmith'
import debugUiPatch from 'metalsmith-debug-ui/patch'

const metalsmith = Metalsmith('src')

const debugUiMetalsmith = debugUiPatch(metalsmith)

debugUiMetalsmith
  .use(myFirstPlugin({...}))
  .use(mySecondPlugin({...}))
  .use(myThirdPlugin({...}))
  .build(...)
```

### metalsmith CLI / metalsmith.json
This plugin won't work in metalsmith CLI mode.

### errors during build
When a plugin throws an error metalsmith will just die as per normal behaviour, but the data debug-ui has collected will still be written to the build dir.

The only problem is that if you're using a dev server like `metalsmith-dev-server` you won't be able to view the ui to see what went wrong. I recommend implementing [browser-sync][browser-sync] or something instead.
