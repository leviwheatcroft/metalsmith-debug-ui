Browser based debug interface for [metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io)

Provides nice ui to navigate metalsmith files and metadata, allowing you to view any stage of the build process

Features:

 * nice ui for exploring files & metadata
 * can jump forwards and backwards through the build process
 * cool react based client

## install

`npm i --save metalsmith-debug-ui`

## usage
`metalsmith-debug-ui` clones your metalsmith files and metadata strutures at
different times during the build process and stores this history. Then it
injects a browser based client into your build output which allows you to view
that history.

### patch mode
This will report after every plugin. You need to patch your metalsmith instance.

```javascript
import Metalsmith from 'metalsmith'
import { patch } from 'metalsmith-debug-ui'

let ms = Metalsmith('src')

patch(ms)

ms
.use(...)
.build(...)
```

### report mode

Just call `report` as a plugin

```javascript
import Metalsmith from 'metalsmith'
import { report } from 'metalsmith-debug-ui'

let ms = Metalsmith('src') // no need to patch

ms
.use(myFirstPlugin({...}))
.use(mySecondPlugin({...}))
.use(report('stage 1'))
.use(myFirstPlugin({...}))
.use(report('stage 2'))
.build(...)
```

### viewing output
The client should be built with the rest of your site, and will be located at `debug-ui/index.html` in your build directory. You should use your favourite static development server to view it in the same way you would view anything else in your build directory.

### errors during build
When a plugin throws an error metalsmith will just die as per normal behaviour, but the data debug-ui has collected will still be written to the build dir.

The only problem is that if you're using a dev server like `metalsmith-dev-server` you won't be able to view the ui to see what went wrong. I recommend implementing [browser-sync][browser-sync] or something instead.

### anonymous plugins
It's difficult to reliably detect the names of plugins in order to report them in the ui. debug-ui first tries to sniff the plugin name from a stack trace, if that fails it checks whether the plugin returns a named function, and if that fails it will simply list the plugin as `anonymous`.

In most cases this is satisfactory. If something is reported as anonymous you can easily work out what it is by looking at the plugins before and after it.

## demo
see [metalsmith-all-the-things][metalsmith-all-the-things] for a full working
demo.

## options
nil

## plugin compatibility
Some plugins may not write to the `debug-ui` log, although I haven't found any
yet. In theory any plugins using `debug v2.x.x` should work. If you find one
please post an issue.

## testing
nil.

## building
Deprecation warning re: parseQuery is from upstream package. Don't worry about
it.

`npm run watch`
